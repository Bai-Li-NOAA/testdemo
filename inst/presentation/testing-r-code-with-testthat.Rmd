# Testing R code with {testthat}

```{r eval=FALSE}
test_that("multiplication works", {
  expect_equal(2 * 2, 4)
  expect_equal(2 * 3, 6)
})

test_that("division works", {
  expect_equal(4 / 2, 2)
})

```

- Example test

  - A test is one function call that starts with `test_that(" ", {})`
    
  - A test file can hold one or more `test_that()` tests
    
  - Each test has a name to describe what it is testing: e.g., "multiplication works" and "division works"
    
  - An expectation is a function call that starts with `expect_XXX`. See more examples from {testthat} .hyperlink-style[[function reference](https://testthat.r-lib.org/reference/index.html)]

  - Each test can have one or more expectations

# Case 1: Testing an R function from an R package

- The `divide_by()` function from .hyperlink-style[[R/math_function.R](https://github.com/Bai-Li-NOAA/testdemo/blob/main/R/math_function.R)]
  - Division of two numbers
      
```{r eval=FALSE}
#' @title Division of two numbers
#'
#' @param dividend A number that is being divided in the division process.
#' @param divisor A number that by which the dividend is being divided by.
#' @return A number obtained in the division process.
#' @examples
#' divide_by(10, 2.5)
#' divide_by(8, 3)
#' @export
divide_by <- function(dividend, divisor){
  result <- dividend / divisor
}
```

---
# Case 1: Testing an R function from an R package

- Create a paired test file .hyperlink-style[[tests/testthat/test-math_function.R](https://github.com/Bai-Li-NOAA/testdemo/blob/main/tests/testthat/test-math_function.R)]


```{r eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_test(name = "math_function")
```

--

```{r eval=FALSE}
test_that("divide_by() works", {

  #' @description Testing that divide_by(10, 2.5) returns a number of 4
  expect_equal(
    object = divide_by(10, 2.5),
    expected = 4
  )

  #' @description Testing that divide_by(2, 0) returns Inf
  expect_equal(
    object = divide_by(2, 0),
    expected = Inf
  )

  #' @description Testing that divide_by(3) returns an error
  expect_error(
    object = divide_by(3)
  )

})

```

---
# Case 1: Testing an R function from an R package

- Workflow
  
  - Did I develop the function correctly?
  
      - Run `devtools::test(filter = "math_function")` to execute a single test

  - Did I break other code in the codebase?
  
      - Run `devtools::test()` to execute all tests in a package

  - Could my tests pass with devtools::test() but fail with `devtools::check()` because I made a faulty assumption about the testing environment?
  
      - Run `devtools::check()` to build and check the package using all known best practices

---
# Case 1: Testing an R function from an R package

- What to test

  - Correctness of both inputs and outputs
      - Type input and output data
      - Dimension of input and output data
  - Built-in errors, warnings, or messages

???
Think more boundary conditions and corner cases.
Write tests that fail when the behavior of code changes.
---
# Case 2: Testing a nested R function from an R package

- The nested R function from .hyperlink-style[[R/nested_function.R](https://github.com/Bai-Li-NOAA/testdemo/blob/main/R/nested_function.R)]
  
  - nested_function calls `add()` and `divide_by()` functions

```{r eval=FALSE}
#' @title Nested function
#'
#' @param a A number.
#' @param b A number.
#' @return A number obtained using both add and divide_by functions.
#' @examples nested_function(10, 2)
#' @export
nested_function <- function(a, b){
  testdemo::add(a, b) + testdemo::divide_by(a, b)
}
```
---
# Case 2: Testing a nested R function from an R package

- Integration test
  - Check individual components
  - Verify that `add()` and `divide_by()` functions work together as designed in the `nested_function()`

```{r eval=FALSE}
test_that("nested_function() works", {
  #' @description Testing that nested_function(3, 2) returns 6.5
  # Manual calculation: (3+2)+(3/2) = 6.5
  expect_equal(
    object = nested_function(3, 2),
    expected = 6.5
  )

  #' @description Testing that nested_function(4, 2) returns 8
  # Call add() and divide_by() before setting up the test
  add_result <- add(4, 2)
  divide_by_result <- divide_by(4, 2)
  expected_result <- add_result + divide_by_result

  expect_equal(nested_function(4, 2), expected_result)
})
```

---
# Case 2: Testing a nested R function from an R package

- Unit test using {mockery}
  - Stub out `add()` function with a value of 3
  - Stub out `divide_by()` function with a value of 2

```{r eval=FALSE}
test_that("nested_function() works with mock objects", {

  #' @description Testing that nested_function() returns 5 using mock objects
  # Set the output of testdemo::add() to 3
  mockery::stub(testdemo::nested_function, "testdemo::add", 3)
  # Set the output of testdemo::divide_by() to 2
  mockery::stub(testdemo::nested_function, "testdemo::divide_by", 2)
  object_result <- testdemo::nested_function(3, 2)
  expect_equal(
    object = object_result,
    3 + 2
  )

})
```

- `testthat::with_mock()` has similar functionality
- `mockery::stub()` can stub out functions from base R packages while `testthat::with_mock` can not

---
# Case 3: Testing a data set from an R package
- The data set from .hyperlink-style[[R/data_assamc.R](https://github.com/Bai-Li-NOAA/testdemo/blob/main/R/data_assamc.R)]
  
  - The data-creating script from .hyperlink-style[[data-raw/data_assamc.R](https://github.com/Bai-Li-NOAA/testdemo/blob/main/data-raw/data_assamc.R)]
  - Create a simulated data set using the operating model from ASSAMC package (.hyperlink-style[[Li et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.7755/FB.119.2-3.5)])

```{r eval=FALSE}

Basic workflow: Write code, write tests, and then check if tests pass
Test-driven development philosophy: write tests first and then update code to make tests pass
  
Build a safety net so changes do not break existing functionality. 
The difference in growth dynamics between projects with good and bad tests. A project with badly written tests exhibits the properties of a project with good tests at the beginning, but it eventually falls into the stagnation phase.
